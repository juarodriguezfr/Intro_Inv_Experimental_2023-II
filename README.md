# Research Project: Standard Candles Distance Measurement with Earth Luminous Sources

## Overview

This repository contains documents and resources related to our research project focused on testing the standard candles distance measurement method using Earth luminous sources like lightbulbs, cameras, and satellite images.

## Description

The goal of this research project is to investigate and validate the feasibility of using Earth luminous sources, such as lightbulbs, in combination with cameras and satellite images for distance measurement using the standard candles method. This innovative approach has the potential to provide an educative approach to the astronomical distance measurement techniques, particularly in scenarios where traditional methods are impractical or inaccessible, besides, using other complementary data such as satellite image to cross the information obtained. The project has the potential to evolve towards a light pollution research.
